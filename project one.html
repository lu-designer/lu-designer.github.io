            <section class="project-description">
            <p> Through a series of background, qualitative research methods such as survey and interview, I was able to understand user’s needs and concerns and thereafter came up with user profiles and personas.   </p>
                <p><strong> Background research</strong>  </p>
                <p>
                 
                    Find answers to following questions:
                         </p>
                       <ul>
                    <li>What motivates people to commit acts of altruism;</li>
                    <li>What people’s latent needs when it comes to acts of altruism; </li>
                    <li>Whether or not they find charities fulfil their needs;</li>
                    <li>People’s knowledge about developmental disorders;</li>
                    <li>What problems they find in existing charities.</li>
                </ul>
           
                <p><strong> Quantitative survey </strong>  </p>
                <p>
                    
                     <p>The survey followed a qualitative format with the intention to ask about people’s thought processes and subjective views rather than objective information. I received in total 47 responses for the questionnaire survey.Interesting results have come to life. For instance, more participants prefer to connect with whoever they help than not to connect. </p>

                    <p>
                        I recruited 4 people for the interview. I mainly used open-ended questions to elicit users to reveal their thought processes regarding how effective they think charities are and how well they know about autism spectrum disorder. During the interview process, sample questions were only referred to when I ran out of questions to ask. My approaches to the interview focused on interviewee’s first-hand experiences to particular topics by <strong>probing</strong> and asking related questions to let them reveal more about their thought processes and patterns. 
     <p><strong> Four themes  </strong>  </p>
                <p> 
                    <p> Four themes stood out from interview result analysis.

                    <li>Need a sense of achievement; </li>

                    Scene 1 &amp; 2: Alex was walking out from the library and suddenly he saw a big interactive screen near the library. It is as big as himself. And it seems like something is showing in the screen. He’s curious so he walked close to it and started to interact.
                    
                </p>
                
                  <p>
                      Scene 3: On screen, there’s black background with a child’s image in the middle. His hand is reaching out to Alex but he has a sad face. It says ‘touch hand to start’. So Alex touched child’s hand to see what happens next.
                     </p>
                    <p>
                Scene 4: Next, there are two videos shown side by side on the screen about how autistic child feels like in comparison to normal child. Alex says to himself ‘oh, I didn’t know this.’ And he began to think a bit more about autism. He realised he has only heard about the term but knew nothing about it..
                </p>
                 <p>Scene 5: Some children’s paintings show on screen as well as his own image. Alex liked many of these paintings. He swiped left and right to see more. He posed himself and took a few selfies. He felt a bit silly but was also very happy about this.
                    </p>
                
                <p>
                Scene 6 &amp; 7: He was then asked to choose to print any of his favourite pictures. For each picture, he was asked to donate two dollars to charity for autism. He felt that was worth it. So he chose two pictures and tapped his card on screen. And the pictures came out from the bottom of the device.
                
                </p>
                
                  <p>Scene 8 &amp; 9: He saw the kid that was at the very beginning appeared again on screen but with a happy face this time. A thank you note appeared on screen. Alex felt good about what he just did. A QR code appeared on screen. Alex scanned it with his phone. He now has his photos in digital version so he posted them on Instagram with #autismwithtalents to show his friends and raise people’s awareness.

               <p> Scene 2: She suddenly stopped as she was attracted by the large screen near the bus stop, and there were few students just like her stopped and standing in front of the screen. She then discovered that this big screen is actually a selfie-taking machine. she waited for the previous person finished using the machine and then she went forward to the screen. </p>
                
                
               <p> Scene 3: She was shocked at the first time when she saw a sad boy's face on the screen. she realised that this machine might not be just for taking selfies. </p>
                
                
                <p> Scene 4 : She started to interact with the screen and then watched the video that shown on it. she discovered that this machine is used to help autistic children. She felt quite sympathetic and wanted to help those children. </p>
                
                
                
               <p> Scene 5 : She took some selfies and paid for the photos as she think this is a better way to help autistic children than just randomly donate money to a charity. </p>
                
               <p> Scene 6: She felt a sense of satisfaction about helping people, and went home happily. </p>

                    <li>Physical prototyping is a great way to engage users to test our product. However, it would be great if we made a close to 1:1 ratio of physical model and placed it at the location where the users actually go to. This might give us more interesting insights and feedback. 
</li>
                    <li>It is crucial that we identify all stakeholders at the very beginning of the process. For this project, it was easy to only focus on raising awareness, which neglects the needs of charities for raising funding in their autistic projects. Therefore, a call for action was equally important in the design concept. 
 </li>
                    <li>Communication is crucial at the early stage of the process and the basic direction has to be made clear across the board of all team members. 
 </li>
