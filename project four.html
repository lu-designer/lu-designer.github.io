             <h2> Problem  </h2>  
           <p> COVID 19 has utterly changed how people interact with each other. Social isolation, fear of unknown, unhelpful comments online all contributed to our increased level of anxiety. Social interaction at times as such is in jeopardy.

                    <li> Lantern displays messages in a rotating way  </li>

                      <li>  When user interacts,  lantern lights up, music starts playing; and lantern goes dim and music stops when user stops interaction.   </li>
                    
                </ul>
            
            
            
            <h2> Develop prototype 
   </h2>
        
                            <p> Processing and Max were the main tools I used in developing prototypes.   </p>

            Ultimately, API data from social media sites will be collected with people’s messages under #lightthelantern. For the virtual experience, I imported text files to represent social media messages.

                           Dr Luke Hespanhol created a server and client system framework, which ensured that users can interact with our design remotely and virtually under the same  network. I transitioned the original codes to fit this framework.

                Three rounds of user testing was conducted via Zoom. Users used "client codes" to interact with the server screen at a Zoom virtual meeting room. User testing plan was previously prepared, including a scenario task statement and a survey questionnaire after the task completed.

                <p> Due to the coronavirus circumstance, we held a virtual exhibition on Zoom  where users visited our <b>‘Virtual Gallery’</b>. 

In order to allow the interaction to happen, I transitioned the original codes to suit a server and client framework. When users entered my Zoom gallery, they needed to turn on their client framework and connect to the same VPN network as me. They could then interact with the server screen using client codes.

                <p> The virtual exhibition went successfully. Six people entered my virtual exhibition room. Majority of them were able to understand the interaction without much explanation. Some users didn’t realise that they could type and post words until I told them. Many noticed different shimmering effects on lanterns. Everyone understood what went on in overhead photo. Many of them expressed <b>feelings of calmness and a sense of immersion</b>.

   </h2>
               <section class="project-description">
             
       <p> This project was an independent project due to social restriction. There has been ups and downs in the process. The biggest challenge I’ve had was to cope with sudden changes along the way, such as, transition codes to fit the client and server framework. Although it was quite challenging, it is also a very fulfilling and enjoyable experience overall. The positive feedback and acknowledgement from peers and tutors make all the efforts worthwhile.
