             <h2> Problem  </h2>  
           <p> COVID 19 has utterly changed how people interact with each other. Social isolation, fear of unknown, unhelpful comments online all contributed to our increased level of anxiety. Social interaction at times as such is in jeopardy. 
</p>
            <p class="redwords">  How do we facilitate or redefine human interactions within the constraints of social distancing in a global pandemic?

                 <p> Through secondary research, I came across a cultural activity named ‘kongming lantern’ in Asia. In local cultures, kongming lanterns represent hopes and wishes. When being released to the sky, wishful messages are thought to be received by the universe.</p>
                     
                 <p>  So I drew upon the metaphor of kongming lantern when conceptualising this interactive digital installation with the hope of  <b>creating a space where people can reconcile with what's going on and make wish to the future</b>.

It also has a few high-rise apartment buildings nearby which make sure the design to be viewed by the residents in their apartments. </p>
            <p > To better fit in the aesthetic of this chosen location, I transformed the concept of ‘flying lanterns’ to a digital river lantern installation.

            Ultimately, API data from social media sites will be collected with people’s messages under #lightthelantern. For the virtual experience, I imported text files to represent social media messages.

           <p>                  
               Three lanterns are displayed to demonstrate the transition of visiting different lanterns in real life. I added the <b>candle light shimmering effects </b>to three lanterns. The first lantern "shimmers" based on the pitch of sounds in the  environment, second one on the frequency, third one on the timbre.

                <p> Due to the coronavirus circumstance, we held a virtual exhibition on Zoom  where users visited our <b>‘Virtual Gallery’</b>. 

In order to allow the interaction to happen, I transitioned the original codes to suit a server and client framework. When users entered my Zoom gallery, they needed to turn on their client framework and connect to the same VPN network as me. They could then interact with the server screen using client codes.

                <p> The virtual exhibition went successfully. Six people entered my virtual exhibition room. Majority of them were able to understand the interaction without much explanation. Some users didn’t realise that they could type and post words until I told them. Many noticed different shimmering effects on lanterns. Everyone understood what went on in overhead photo. Many of them expressed <b>feelings of calmness and a sense of immersion</b>.

   </h2>
               <section class="project-description">
             
       <p> This project was an independent project due to social restriction. There has been ups and downs in the process. The biggest challenge I’ve had was to cope with sudden changes along the way, such as, transition codes to fit the client and server framework. Although it was quite challenging, it is also a very fulfilling and enjoyable experience overall. The positive feedback and acknowledgement from peers and tutors make all the efforts worthwhile.
