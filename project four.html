            <section class="project-description">
                <p>COVID 19 has utterly changed how people interact with each other. Social isolation, fear of unknown, unhelpful comments online  all contributed to our increased level of anxiety. Social interaction at times as such is in jeopardy. </p>

            <p> So how do we facilitate, nurture or redefine human interactions within the constraints of social distancing in a global pandemic?  </p>

            <h2> Problem  </h2>  
           <p> Through background research, I found that people during Covid19 longe for a stronger sense of connection and mutual support. So the question shall be raised is: </p>
            <p> How can we create a design that invites people to interact with it while raises a sense of empathy and mutual support without sacrificing social distancing regulations?

                 <p> Through background research, I came across a cultural practice named ‘kongming lanterns’ in  Asia. In local culture, kongming lanterns represent hopes and wishes. When being released to the sky, wishful messages are thought to be received by the universe. So I drew upon the metaphor of kongming lantern and turned it into a digital river lantern installation wishing to <b>create a space where people can reconcile</b>.

                <p> <strong>Stage 1 </strong></p>

                <p>A social media campaign introduces the event of Week of Hope to local community. The idea is to invite community members to post wishful thoughts and positive messages on their social media accounts with #lightthelantern to stand in solidarity with the world that suffers during COVID19.

                    <p> <strong>Stage 2 </strong></p>
                
                <p>Week of Hope event carries out during week one of June 2020. Digital lanterns will be displayed afloat on Parramatta River. Lanterns are made with translucent water-proof material. The frontside of each lantern is embedded with LED lights and acts as a LED screen. Each lantern also has an infrared sensor that detects movements at night and a built-in speaker. 
 </p>
                <img class="con" src="images/p4-lantern%20front.png"> 
    
                
               <p> When the infrared sensor detects an object nearby, lantern will be switched from dim to bright and the messages people posted on social media will start scrolling up on lantern screen. Exotic and calm melody starts to play. </p>

            <h2> Ideation
   </h2>
           
          <p>  Due to COVID19, producing physical products became impossible. Therefore, I focused on delivering an interactive online experience to simulate what the real-life experience would look like.

                    <p> When ideating the concept, I had following ideas in mind:

                  <ul>
                    <li> Lantern displays messages in a rotating way  </li>

                      <li>  When user interacts,  lantern lights up, music starts playing; and lantern goes dim and music stops when user stops interaction.   </li>

             Processing and Max were the main developing tools I used. Ultimately, <b>API data </b> from social media sites will be collected with people’s messages under #lightthelantern. For the virtual experience, I imported text files to represent social media messages.

           <p>                  
               Three lanterns are displayed to demonstrate the transition of visiting different lanterns in real life. I added the <b>candle light shimmering effects </b>to three lanterns. The first lantern "shimmers" based on the pitch of sounds in the  environment, second one on the frequency, third one on the timbre.

                           Dr Luke Hespanhol created a server and client system framework, which ensured that users can interact with our design remotely and virtually under the same  network. I transitioned the original codes to fit this framework.
                          
                    </p>
        
            
                           
                      <p>
                Three rounds of user testing was conducted via Zoom. Users used client side of code to interact with the server screen at a Zoom virtual meeting room.

Instead, users could type and post messages from client side during visiting and messages would display in middle lantern. This way, it becomes more relevant to the concept of sending wishful messages. </p>

                <p> Due to the coronavirus circumstance, we held a virtual exhibition on Zoom  where users visited our <b>‘Virtual Gallery’</b>. 

In order to allow the interaction to happen, I transitioned the original codes to suit a server and client framework. When users entered my Zoom gallery, they needed to turn on their client framework and connect to the same VPN network as me. They could then interact with the server screen using their client framework.

       <p> This project was an independent project due to social restriction. There has been ups and downs in the process. The biggest challenge I’ve had was to cope with sudden changes along the way, such as, transition codes to fit the client and server framework. Although it was quite challenging, it is also a very fulfilling and enjoyable experience overall. The positive feedback and acknowledgement from peers and tutors make all the efforts worthwhile.
