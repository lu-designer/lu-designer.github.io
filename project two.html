            <p> 
Through online ethnography, I identified that many users believe that the currently available smart home products are just products that can do ‘smart’ things. But the commenters online questioned whether they actually make people’s lives easier. 
  </p>
                
                 <h3>Interview</h3>         
              
                
               <p>  Before we started designing our wireframes, we interviewed 5 people to investigate their needs and issues in the bathroom environment and what functions they expect to see in a smart bathroom system. We went through and collected their ideas and put them into consideration during we designed the wireframes.</p>

</li>
                    <li>Health and wellbeing are regarded as the fundamental user needs within the smart bathroom context. </li>
                    <li>Privacy issues have been greatly concerned by users.</li>

              In this project, I realised how conceptual models of people can vary from one person to another. What I considered to be excellent design would only work insufficiently to another person. Therefore, I learned that it is super important to test the prototypes early on and make iterations along the way.
