           <h3> Overview </h3>
            <section class="project-description">
          <p>The current IoT products propose only separated solutions - focus on being ‘connected’ rather than being ‘intelligent’. The question remains - how can IoT products be smart enough to ‘talk to each other’ and take care of things before users realise. The task of this smart bathroom mobile app is to intelligently connect bathroom devices together. With simple steps of setting up, users can rest assure that their enjoyable bath time is ready before they know it.   </p>

          <p>Consulting Project at School of Architecture, Design and Planning, University of Sydney </p>
  <h3> Duration </h3>
                     <p>3 months  </p>
                <h3> My role </h3>
          <p> I worked alongside three other product design studnets. Each of us was responsible for one form-factor of smart bathroom system. I was in charge of designing the smarth bathroom mobile app. My tasks included the entire process of design - user &amp; background research, conceptualising, prototyping (low &amp; high fidelity), iterating and testing.</p>

            <h2> User research  </h2>
            <section class="project-description">
            <p> 
Through conducting online ethnography, I identified that many users think that the currently available smart home products are just products that can do ‘smart’ things. The current methodology of smart home is about connecting dots — having devices to work together under the control of the user, which is making people’s lives easier and more efficient. But the commenters online questioned whether it actually makes people’s lives better.  
  </p>
                <p><strong> Desgin focus</strong>  </p>
                <p>
                 
                   
Our design focus was to ‘connect the dots’ to therefore build an intelligent IoT system. We chose to focus on bathroom instead of the whole house so that the built system is targeted. The smart bathroom mobile app works as a remote control system. Users can set up bath water temperature, lighting style and music style and so on remotely before they arrive home from work. Users can also track bathroom hygiene report and their health report on this app.

                         <p>Peter is 35 years old who works as a banker. At around 5pm on Friday, he finishes work. While he walks towards home and he thinks that it would be great to have a warm bath when he gets back. Then he puts out his smart phone and opens the Smart Bathroom Application. He sets the bath temperature to be at 45°C, warm lights on and his favourite music playlist to start playing by the time he gets home.

       <p> <strong>Interview</strong></p>          
              
                
               <p>  Before we started designing our wireframes, we interviewed 5 people to investigate their needs and issues in the bathroom environment and what functions they expect to see in a smart bathroom system. We went through and collected their ideas and put them into consideration during we designed the wireframes.</p> 
                
                
                <p> <strong>Affinity diagrams</strong></p>
                <img src="images/affritniy%20diagram.png"  alt="survey-1">
                <p> We analysed the background research and our report gaps and opportunities to determine the direction of the system design. Affinity diagrams were conducted to identify the major user needs and issues. Three aspects were mainly emphasised on: user health, comfort &amp; relaxation, other personal needs.
                </p>
        
                 <p><strong> User needs </strong>  </p>
              
                    <ul>
                    <li>Users need an IoT solution that can run more systematically and intelligently. 
</li>
                    <li>Health and wellbeing are regarded as the fundamental user needs within the smart bathroom context. </li>
                    <li>Privacy issues have been greatly concerned by users.</li>
                    <li>Some people who have visual impairment or prefer to use voice control.</li>
                 
                </ul>

                
     <p> <strong>Mobile app flow chart</strong></p>
                <img src="images/transparent.png"  alt="survey-1">
                <p> The mobile app is used when users need to remote control the settings of smart bathroom when they are not at home. The pre-set functions include three parts: temperature, lighting system and music system. In temperature pre-set, users can choose to pre-set bath water temperature, bathroom AC and toilet seat temperature. In lighting system pre-set, users set the colour combinations and lighting atmosphere (bright/dim/soft). In music system (surround stereo) pre-set, users will be asked to sync their favourite music playlist (e.g. Spotify playlist) to the bathroom sound system. Users can also synchronise the lighting system to the music playlist. 
                    </p>
                <p>  Besides, users’ daily schedules can be edited and sent to be displayed on smart mirror from their app. They can also check bathroom hygienic report and personal health report, and connect them to smart mirror via the app.

                <p>In two rounds of user test, we choose totally 16 participants with 8 for each round, and 2 for each form-factor respectively. They are similarly from 20 to 25 years old. They are students from the unit of Interface Design at University of Sydney, which indicates that they have the ability to evaluate the design from the professional perspective. Besides, our smart bathroom targets all general users. They are also a part of our target users.

                <p> In the main page, there are icons about lighting preset and music preset. But in the following page, user will be directed to lighting and music preset page. This was quite confusing to the tester. So in low-fi prototype, I took out the ‘lighting and music preset’ part and expended it to three sections to keep it user friendly. 
                </p>

                <p> User tester was confused about ‘start time’ on the temperature preset part. She wasn’t sure if it was about when the water will start heating up or the time that it will be heated up already. So I changed starting time caption to ‘schedule temperature preset’ and was put after temperature setting.

          <p>
              In this project, I realised how conceptual models of people can vary from one person to another. Sometimes what I considered to be excellent design would only work insufficiently to another person. Therefore, I learned that it is super important to test the prototypes and iterate them where needed. Also tools such as affinity diagram, flow chart and storyboarding are very handy when turning ideas into something tangible.
