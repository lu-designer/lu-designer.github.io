             <h2> Challenge  </h2>  
            <p> 
The exisiting interactive placemaking designs excel at the scale of the display and the creative content. Yet few of them pay attention to create a sense of immersion to participants in the meantime. </p>

            <p class="redwords"> <b>The challenge for this project is to design and implement a novel interactive audio-visual system for urban environments that enables users to gain a sense of immersion and feelings of awe. </b>

       <p> Designing and developing ‘Multiverse’ was such a fun experience. During a quarantine situation, it was impossible to conduct face-to-face user tests and build real products. So I had to think outside the box to make physical prototypes with limited resources. I learned that during special occasion such as a global pandemic, the challenge can also become an opportunity to exercise our creative muscles.
